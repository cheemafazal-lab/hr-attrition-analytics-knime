ITAO 7102 – Human Resources Analytics  
MSc Business Analytics  

## Project Overview
This project analyses employee attrition in a pharmaceutical organisation using predictive analytics. The objective was to identify key drivers of attrition and build models capable of identifying employees at risk of leaving.

The analysis follows the CRISP-DM methodology and combines data preparation, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Tools Used
- KNIME (data preparation & modelling)
- Tableau (visualisation)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Key Findings
- Attrition is strongly associated with overtime and workload intensity.
- Early tenure employees show higher risk of leaving.
- Random Forest outperformed Decision Tree (85.1% accuracy vs 71.7%).
- Predictive models should support managerial decisions, not automate them.

## Workflow
The KNIME workflow includes:
- Data cleaning (Missing Value, Rule Engine, Outlier detection)
- Feature engineering (Binning, Type casting, Filtering)
- Train/test split
- Decision Tree & Random Forest models
- Confusion matrix evaluation

## Repository Structure
- `/workflow` – KNIME workflow file
- `/report` – Submitted academic report
- `/presentation` – Slides used for presentation
- `/screenshots` – Visual outputs (optional)
